# ClientProject-St-MaryChurch

Our team was tasked with proposing a solution to address inefficiencies in data management at St. Mary's Catholic Church, including parish registration, sacramental preparation, and record-keeping. The primary Church functions involve parish registration and sacramental preparation inquiries. Centralizing these processes into a unified system would greatly enhance record management efficiency, freeing up parish staff for more direct communication and pastoral ministry. 

Analysis of the current system revealed that issues stem from a lack of centralized database and that the current PDS system has limited technical and access capabilities, leading to data inconsistencies and difficulty in accessing and updating member information. Our proposed solution is a web-based record management system called AirTable, which includes a centralized database and user-friendly interface that organizes records in an intuitive and tabular manner that is easy to update and search.

The key objectives of the new system are search and filter capabilities for Parish workers to find members in the system, the ability for members to access and update their own information, the ability for Parish workers to access, update, add, and delete all member information, assign appropriate access levels for all users, and receive email alerts for missing and incomplete member profile and sacrament information. Additionally, the Parish priest will be able to access and print sacrament related information for any member. Furthermore, instead of members filling out paper forms, they will enter information into a website form on the front-end that will send an email with the member information to Madalene who then can transfer the information to the new database. The project constraints include that the solution should be feasible to implement within 1 month or 5 week sprint duration, the technical expertise at St. Mary's Church is minimal so we would need a user friendly solution, the MIS 374 Team might lack the technical skills needed to fully implement a new centralized database thus a packaged solution would aid in providing structure to the database, and the new database system is for internal use but would require data authorization and role assigning features between the administration and members.
One of the major risks to the project is relying heavily on Madelene for system functionality as her absence or unavailability could impede system operations and decision-making processes. To reduce this risk, we have devised the following reduction plan to implement knowledge transfer sessions and comprehensive documentation to reduce reliance on key individuals and enhance team adaptability. Additionally, another risk would be that the MIS team lacks industry experience, there is a risk of misunderstanding requirements or failing to properly communicate with stakeholders. A reduction plan for this risk would be to employ external research, continuous learning, and stakeholder engagement strategies to mitigate the risk associated with the team's lack of industry expertise. The last risk would be the project implementation time of 1 month or 5 weeks for the sprint duration. A reduction plan is to prioritize efficiency and agile methodologies to ensure timely delivery within the project timeline.

We remain dedicated to delivering a solution aligned with furthering the church's mission of serving the community. Please let us know if there are any questions we can answer.

Sincerely,
Actionable Advisors
